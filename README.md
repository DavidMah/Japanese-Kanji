# Japanese Kanji Self Study Thing

This is just a compilation of many early grade kanji
that can be viewed in a web browser

## Random Page

**index.html**

In the textarea, enter ids of kanji(given by kanji pages), and separate
them with whitespace.

Click **generate** to have symbols of those kanji appear on the web page.

Click **shuffle** to rearrange the order of kanji currently on the page.

**Click a symbol** to remove its visibility. That kanji won't exist anymore
when you click shuffle again.

There's three other input boxes on the page. The higher two are a range
where you can type in two integers. Click add to add all integers in
that range to the text area.

For example, if i write 42 in the first box, and 50 in the second box,
and then I click add, 42 through 50 will all be written to the text box
for me.

As for the third box, if you have written a number **n** into that box,
then clicking **Choose Randomly** will cause **n** many ids random
chosen from the range to appear.

## Kanji Pages

Open **/final/<integer>** and you can see a kanji, its pronounciations, meanings, and some common compounds. Change the url to see a different kanji. The ids of each kanji are arbitrary
