A bunch of hacks thrown together for my kanji reading practice

## Kanji Pages
open /final/__anything__ and you can see a kanji, its pronounciations, meanings, and some common compounds. Change the url to see a different kanji. The ids of each kanji are arbitrary

## Random Page
random/random.html
Enter ids of kanji into the textarea separated by spaces, and the images of those kanji will be shuffled and output below. Useful for self quizzing

# misc
Helper files for the pages; css and template html for the pages
